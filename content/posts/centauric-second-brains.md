The concept of a second brain is a system for capturing, organizing, distilling, and expressing information. While productivity tools like notetaking apps serve as the central system, their capabilities are limited to just storing information. This essay explores the potential of the second brain as a centaur, where AI and humans blend together to form a potent combination. We examine how greater integration between the components could lead to access to human thoughts, making the centaur part of their second brain.

The concept of a second brain is that of a repository for thoughts, resources, and memories that Tiago Forte pioneered the in his book "Building a Second Brain". It consists of four primary steps involving the capturing, organization, distillation, and expression of information. A typical "second brain" will usually involve a productivity tool such as a notetaking app serving as the central system for the performance of these steps.

While second brains are useful, they are not nearly living up to their full potential if they only remember without thought. Second brains automate the memorization and recollection of ideas, is overselling when they could automate much of the organization and expression of those same ideas. While today's notetaking apps are exceptionally good at storing memory, tomorrow's notetaking apps will be able to process the memories.  For a second brain to truly live up to its name, it needs to think beyond just remembering your thoughts. 

There is also the concept in AI called the centaur. A centaur is somebody who works side by side with AI, blending mind of the human with the body of the computer. The computer has sheer processing capabilities and unending knowledge of the world around us, but the human has sheer experience, memories, and unending knowledge of themselves. Together, they form a potent combination.

However, despite all of the recent advancements in the field of AI, the centaur still relies on the human for much of the actual tedious thoughtwork and ideology. While the human can access the entirety of the machine, the computers cannot access the entirety of the human without risking creating the dreaded "reverse-centaur", a human at the mercy of the AI systems governing their day-to-day life.

If the centaur gains greater integration between its components through access to the human's thoughts, then becomes a part of their second brain.

And while today's LLMs are exceptionally good at knowing the world, tomorrow's LLms will be exceptionally good at knowing *you*.
