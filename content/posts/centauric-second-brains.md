We have AI that knows the world, but we need AI that knows the user.

Human: What is the capital of Senegal?
AI: The capital of Senegal is Dakar.
Human: When did I go to Dakar?
AI: I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to your personal information or past experiences. Therefore, I cannot know when you may have gone to Dakar.

INSERT INTRODUCTION HERE

The concept of a second brain is that of a repository for thoughts, resources, and memories. Tiago Forte pioneered the idea in his book "Building a Second Brain". It consists of four primary steps involving the capturing, organization, distillation, and expression of information. A typical "second brain" will usually involve a productivity tool such as a notetaking app serving as the external system for the performance of these steps.

While second brains are useful, they are not nearly living up to their full potential if they only remember without thought. Second brains automate the memorization and recollection of ideas, but they could automate much of the organization and expression of the same ideas. While today's notetaking apps are exceptionally good at storing memory, tomorrow's notetaking apps will be able to process the memories.  Brains think, memories don't. For a second brain to truly live up to its name, it needs to think beyond just remembering your thoughts. 

There is a concept in AI called the centaur. A centaur is somebody who works side by side with AI, blending mind of the human with the body of the computer. The computer has sheer processing capabilities and unending knowledge of the world around us, but the human has sheer experience, memories, and unending knowledge of themselves. Together, they form a potent combination.

However, despite all of the recent advancements in the field of AI, the centaur still relies on the human for much of the actual tedious thoughtwork and ideology. While the human can access the entirety of the machine, the computers cannot access the entirety of the human without risking creating the dreaded "reverse-centaur", a humans at the mercy of the AI systems governing their day-to-day life.

But these two problems solve each other.  The centaur gains greater integration between its components through access to the human's second brain, and in doing so can become a part of their second brain.

And while today's LLMs are exceptionally good at knowing the world, tomorrow's LLms will be exceptionally good at knowing *you*.
