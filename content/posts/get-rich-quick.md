I made Get Rich Quick for a hackathon hosted by my school. At the time, I was very new to GoDot, so from the start I tried to limit my scope to something I knew I could accomplish in the time given. I already had created a basic platformer character controller that I call "Dennis", so I figured that a platforming game would be of relative ease.

Dennis has coin collection built in, and during a game jam it is important to make the most out of the resources that you have. However, I have always hated not collecting all of the coins in platformers; something about leaving coins floating there has always felt wrong to me. This purely aesthetic choice ended up informing much of the game design later on.

In my opinion, the most important game design element to optimize for is replayability. A fun game without replayability will be enjoyable, but a the best replayable games become a lifestyle. While the best replayable games are replayable because of the sheer depth of the game mechanics, during a game jam... that's just too much work. So in the end, I decided to go with a speedrunning game about collecting all of the coins in a single level.

Visuals are the first things players will interact with in a game and can even be a deciding factor in whether the play the game at all, so I believe that much of people's first impressions on a game will be determined by aethetics most of all. It is for this reason that I created a parallax scrolling background, something I had never done before. I also spent a great deal of time at the end of the jam just slapping in random shaders from godotshaders.org.

One thing I made sure to do was to make collecting the coins look as appealing as possible. Between a "shine" shader, particles flying out in all directions, and the bobbing up and down, everything about them was designed to players *want* to collect them. The once again tied back to my discomfort with leaving coins uncollected.

The level design was a bit of a mess. I tried to include some alternative paths through the level, again for replayability, but they ended up being much harder to include than I had expected. One thing I was proud of, though, was the first four coins. I think they do a good job introducing the character to their movement mechanics.

Overall, I think that the game went quite well for what was essentially my first GoDot game, but in the future I want to work more on creating some more interesting game mechanics. Thank you for reading, and I would appreciate if you would download the game.
